# Taskify

A modern project and task management application built with Next.js, Prisma, and Better Auth. This project was built to demonstrate how vulnerabilities can creep into our applications if we're not careful with our code practices.

## Week 1

There are intentional security flaws sprinkled throughout the codebase for educational purposes:

1. SQL Injection - Project search feature if vulnerable to SQL Injection attack
2. Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Project descriptions are not sanitized and user-defined content is inserted directly into the DOM
3. Broken Access Control /Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) - Users can access projects and tasks that do not belong to them by manipulating URL parameters.

Viewers are encouraged to clone and explore the codebase, identify these vulnerabilities, and mitigate them in ways that follow best security practices and support existing features.

Directions on how to exploit these vulnerabilities can be found in the [vulnerabilities.md](https://github.com/KylerJohnsonDev/Tek_innov8ers/blob/main/vulnerabilities.md) file.

## Week 2

Find a Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) tool and integrate it into your CI pipeline. One example of this is [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/).

## App Features

- 📁 Project management with descriptions

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Database:** SQLite with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication:** Better Auth
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui
- **Language:** TypeScript

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.19 or higher
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kylerjohnsondev/tek_innov8ers.git
cd tek_innov8ers
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your_better_auth_secret"
```
Run `npm run better-auth:secret` to generate a secure Better Auth secret to the console, which you can copy and paste into your `.env` file.

4. **Set up the database:**

```bash
# Initialize the database and run migrations
npm run db:init

# Seed the database with initial data (optional)
npm run db:seed
```

5. **Run the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

Note: If you ran the command to seed the database, you can log in with the following credentials:
- User: John Doe
  - email: john.doe@taskify.com
  - password: password123

- User: Jane Doe
  - email: jane.doe@taskify.com
  - password: password123
